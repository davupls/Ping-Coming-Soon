## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

```html
<form action="#" id="form" novalidate> 
  <!-- Learn that default browser alert message can be disabled using novalidate -->
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
else if (form.reportValidity()) {
  form.submit();
  emailInput.value = "";
  alertContainer.innerText = "";  
  emailInput.style.border = "2px solid black";
}
// Using reportValidity I can check using the browser email validity checker in a "if condition"
```

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me to quickly find what html attribute, css property, or javascript method I could use.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Where I search to find explanation of everything related to html, css or javascript.
